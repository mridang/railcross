# Railcross for GitHub

> A brief description of what your Probot app does.

Railcross prevents your teams from merging pull requests outside
merge windows.
Merge windows allow you to restrict the days and
times that pull requests may be merged.

Think of it as a railway crossing, you can't cross until the
train has passed. üöÇ

Railcross is a low-overhead app and simply prevents your team
from merging between 0900 and 1600. It does this by locking the
branch protection rule of your default branch.
Any existing branch protection rules (even on the same branch) are not affected.

## Developing

Railcross is built with Typescript using the Probot framework and
requires Node 20 to run.

After checking out the repository, run `npm install` to install all
the required dependencies.

In order to develop the application, you must have a GitHub app of
your own.

### Linting the code

Lint the code using `npm run lint`. This command runs ESLint and
lints all the files.

### Formatting the code

Reformat the code using `npm run format`. This runs Prettier and
reformats all the code.

### Deploying the app

Deploy the app using `npm run deploy`.

‚ö†Ô∏èYou'll need to ensure that you have the AWS credentials configured. Read the
guide on how to configure the variables https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html
